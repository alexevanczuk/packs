# Packs first mode

Packs first mode can be used if your entire team is using `packs`. Currently, the only thing this does is change the copy in `package_todo.yml` files to reference `pks` instead of `packwerk`.

There are two ways to enable this:
1. Rename `packwerk.yml` to `packs.yml` and packs first mode will be automatically enabled.
2. Set `packs_first_mode: true` in your `packwerk.yml`
