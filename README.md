[![Security Audit](https://github.com/alexevanczuk/packs/actions/workflows/audit.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/alexevanczuk/packs/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Security+audit%22++)

A 100% Rust implementation of [packwerk](https://github.com/Shopify/packwerk), a gradual modularization platform for Ruby.

# Goals:
## Serve as a drop-in replacement for `packwerk` on most projects
- Currently can serve as a drop-in replacement on Gusto's extra-large Rails monolith
- This is a work in progress! Please see [Verification](#verification) for instructions on how to verify the output of `packs` is the same as `packwerk`.

## Run 20x faster than `packwerk` on most projects
- Currently ~10-20x as fast as the ruby implementation. See [BENCHMARKS.md](https://github.com/alexevanczuk/packs/blob/main/BENCHMARKS.md).
- Your mileage may vary!
- Other performance improvements are coming soon!

## Support non-Rails, non-zeitwerk apps
- Currently supports non-Rails apps through an experimental implementation
- Uses the same public API as `packwerk`, but has different behavior.
- See [EXPERIMENTAL_PARSER_USAGE.md](https://github.com/alexevanczuk/packs/blob/main/EXPERIMENTAL_PARSER_USAGE.md) for more info

# Usage and Documentation
Once installed and added to your `$PATH`, just call `packs` to see the CLI help message and documentation.
(Note: if you're using [`use_packs`]([url](https://github.com/rubyatscale/use_packs)) AND [`chruby`]([url](https://github.com/capistrano/chruby)), you'll need to instead call `pks` everywhere you'd normally call `packs`.)

```
Welcome! Please see https://github.com/alexevanczuk/packs for more information!

Usage: packs [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  greet                           Just saying hi
  check                           Look for violations in the codebase
  update                          Update package_todo.yml files with the current violations
  validate                        Look for validation errors in the codebase
  check-unnecessary-dependencies  Check for dependencies that when removed produce no violations.
  delete-cache                    `rm -rf` on your cache directory, default `tmp/cache/packwerk`
  list-packs                      List packs based on configuration in packwerk.yml (for debugging purposes)
  list-included-files             List analyzed files based on configuration in packwerk.yml (for debugging purposes)
  list-definitions                List the constants that packs sees and where it sees them (for debugging purposes)
  help                            Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
      --project-root <PROJECT_ROOT>  Path for the root of the project [default: .]
  -d, --debug                        Run with performance debug mode
  -e, --experimental-parser          Run with the experimental parser, which gets constant definitions directly from the AST
      --no-cache                     Run without the cache (good for CI, testing)
  -p, --print-files                  Print to console when files begin and finish processing (to identify files that panic when processing files concurrently)
  -h, --help                         Print help
  -V, --version                      Print version
```

# Installation
See [INSTALLATION.md](https://github.com/alexevanczuk/packs/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md)

# Using with VSCode/RubyMine Extension
`packwerk` has a VSCode Extension: https://github.com/rubyatscale/packwerk-vscode/tree/main
It also has a RubyMine Extension: https://github.com/vinted/packwerk-intellij

Using the extension with `packs` is straightforward and results in a much more responsive experience.

Directions:
- Follow [INSTALLATION.md](https://github.com/alexevanczuk/packs/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md) instructions to install `packs`
- Follow the [configuration](https://github.com/rubyatscale/packwerk-vscode/tree/main#configuration) directions to configure the extension to use `packs` instead of the ruby gem by setting the executable to `packs check`

# Verification
As `packs` is still a work-in-progress, it's possible it will not produce the same results as the ruby implementation (see [Not Yet Supported](#not-yet-supported)). If so, please file an issue â€“ I'd love to try to support your use case!

Instructions:
- Follow the directions above to install `packs`
- Run `packs delete-cache`
- Run `packs update`
- Confirm the output of `git diff` is empty
- Please file an issue if it's not!

# New to Rust?
Me too! This is my first Rust project, so I'd love to have feedback, advice, and contributions!

Rust is a low-level language with high-level abstractions, a rich type system, with a focus on memory safety through innovative compile-time checks on memory usage.

If you're new to Rust, don't be intimidated! [https://www.rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn) has tons of great learning resources.

If you'd like to contribute but don't know where to start, please reach out! I'd love to help you get started.

# Not yet supported
- custom inflections
- custom load paths
- zeitwerk default namespaces
- extensible plugin system

# Benchmarks
See [BENCHMARKS.md](https://github.com/alexevanczuk/packs/blob/main/BENCHMARKS.md)

# Kudos
- Current (@gmcgibbon, @rafaelfranca), and Ex-Shopifolks (@exterm, @wildmaples) for open-sourcing and maintaining `packwerk`
- Gusties, and the [Ruby/Rails Modularity Slack Server](https://join.slack.com/t/rubymod/shared_invite/zt-1dgyrxji9-sihGNX43mVh5T6tw18hFaQ), for continued feedback and support
- @mzruya for the initial implementation and Rust inspiration
