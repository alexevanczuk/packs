[![Security Audit](https://github.com/alexevanczuk/packs/actions/workflows/audit.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/alexevanczuk/packs/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Security+audit%22++)

A 100% Rust implementation of [packwerk](https://github.com/Shopify/packwerk), a gradual modularization platform for Ruby.

# Goals:
## Serve as a drop-in replacement for `packwerk` on most projects
- Currently can serve as a drop-in replacement on Gusto's extra-large Rails monolith
- This is a work in progress! Please see [Verification](#verification) for instructions on how to verify the output of `packs` is the same as `packwerk`.

## Run 20x faster than `packwerk` on most projects
- Currently ~10-20x as fast as the ruby implementation. See [BENCHMARKS.md](https://github.com/alexevanczuk/packs/blob/main/BENCHMARKS.md).
- Your mileage may vary!
- Other performance improvements are coming soon!

## Support non-Rails, non-zeitwerk apps
- Currently supports non-Rails apps through an experimental implementation
- Uses the same public API as `packwerk`, but has different behavior.
- See [EXPERIMENTAL_PARSER_USAGE.md](https://github.com/alexevanczuk/packs/blob/main/EXPERIMENTAL_PARSER_USAGE.md) for more info

      --project-root <PROJECT_ROOT>  Path for the root of the project [default: .]

  -p, --print-files                  Print to console when files begin and finish processing (to identify files that panic when processing files concurrently)

# Installation
See [INSTALLATION.md](https://github.com/alexevanczuk/packs/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md)

# Using with VSCode/RubyMine Extension
`packwerk` has a VSCode Extension: https://github.com/rubyatscale/packwerk-vscode/tree/main

It also has a RubyMine Extension: https://github.com/vinted/packwerk-intellij

Using the extension with `packs` is straightforward and results in a much more responsive experience.

Directions:
- Follow [INSTALLATION.md](https://github.com/alexevanczuk/packs/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md) instructions to install `packs`
- Follow the [configuration](https://github.com/rubyatscale/packwerk-vscode/tree/main#configuration) directions to configure the extension to use `packs` instead of the ruby gem by setting the executable to `packs check`

# Verification
As `packs` is still a work-in-progress, it's possible it will not produce the same results as the ruby implementation (see [Not Yet Supported](#not-yet-supported)). If so, please file an issue â€“ I'd love to try to support your use case!

Instructions:
- Follow the directions above to install `packs`
- Run `packs update`
- Confirm the output of `git diff` is empty
- Please file an issue if it's not!

# New to Rust?
Me too! This is my first Rust project, so I'd love to have feedback, advice, and contributions!

Rust is a low-level language with high-level abstractions, a rich type system, with a focus on memory safety through innovative compile-time checks on memory usage.

If you're new to Rust, don't be intimidated! [https://www.rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn) has tons of great learning resources.

If you'd like to contribute but don't know where to start, please reach out! I'd love to help you get started.

# Not yet supported
- custom inflections
- custom load paths
- extensible plugin system

# Behavioral differences
There are still some known behavioral differences between `packs` and `packwerk`. If you find any, please file an issue!
- `package_paths` must not end in a slash, e.g. `packs/*/` is not supported, but `packs/*` is.
- A `**` in `package_paths` is supported, but is not a substitute for a single `*`, e.g. `packs/**` is supported and will match `packs/*/*/package.yml`, but will not match `packs/*/package.yml`. `packs/*` must be used to match that.

## Default Namespaces
`packs` supports Zeitwerk default namespaces. However, since it doesn't have access to the Rails runtime, you need to explicitly specify the namespaces in `packwerk.yml`.

For example, if you're using [`packs-rails`](https://github.com/rubyatscale/packs-rails) and [`automatic_namespaces`](https://github.com/gap777/automatic_namespaces) to configure your default namespaces, and you have
- `packs/foo/app/models/bar.rb` which is configured to define `Foo::Bar`
- `packs/foo/app/domain/baz.rb` which is configured to define `Foo::Baz`

You'll need to specify the default namespaces in `packwerk.yml` like so:
```yml
autoload_roots:
  packs/foo/app/models: "::Foo"
  packs/foo/app/domain: "::Foo"
```

## Enforcement Globs Ignore
`enforcement_globs_ignore` can be used to specify gitignore-style rules for not enforcing violations.

### Examples

```yml
# packs/product_services/serv1/foo/package.yml
enforce_privacy: true
enforce_visibility: true

enforcement_globs_ignore:
- enforcements:
  - privacy
  - visiblity
  ignores:
  - "**/*"
  # Enforce incoming privacy and visibility violation references _only_ in `packs/product_services/serv1/**/*`
  - "!packs/product_services/serv1/**/*"
```

```yml
# packs/pack2/package.yml
enforce_dependencies: true
dependencies:
# not required because of the below enforcement_globs_ignore
# - packs/pack1 
# required because of the enforcement_globs_ignore exception line 
  - packs/pack3 

enforcement_globs_ignore:
- enforcements:
  - dependency
  ignores:
  - "**/*"
  # Enforce outgoing dependency violation references _only_ to `packs/pack3/**/*`
  - "!packs/pack3/**/*"
```
