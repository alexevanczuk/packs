[![Security Audit](https://github.com/alexevanczuk/packs/actions/workflows/audit.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/alexevanczuk/packs/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Security+audit%22++)

A 100% Rust implementation of [packwerk](https://github.com/Shopify/packwerk), a gradual modularization platform for ruby.

# Goals:
## To be a drop-in replacement for `packwerk` on most projects
- Currently can serve as a drop-in replacement on Gusto's extra-large Rails monolith
- This is a work in progress! Please see [Verification](#verification) for instructions on how to verify the output of `packs` is the same as `packwerk`.

## To be 20x faster than `packwerk` on most projects
- Currently ~10x as fast as the ruby implementation. See [BENCHMARKS.md](https://github.com/alexevanczuk/packs/blob/main/BENCHMARKS.md).
- Your milemage may vary!
- Other performance improvements are coming soon!

# Installation
See [INSTALLATION.md](https://github.com/alexevanczuk/packs/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md)

# Verification
As `packs` is still a work-in-progress, it's possible it will not produce the same results as the ruby implementation (see [Not Yet Supported](#not-yet-supported)). If so, please file an issue â€“ I'd love to try to support your use case!

Instructions:
- Follow directions above to install `packs`
- Run `packs delete_cache`
- Run `packs update`
- Confirm the output of `git diff` is empty
- Please file an issue if it's not!

# New to Rust?
Me too! This is my first Rust project, so I'd love to have feedback, advice, and contributions!

Rust is a low-level language with high-level abstractions, a rich type system, with a focus on memory safety through innovative compile type checks on memory usage.

If you're new to Rust, don't be intimidated! [https://www.rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn) has tons of great learning resources.

If you'd like to contribute but don't know where to start, please reach out! I'd love to help you get started.

# Not yet supported
- architecture and visibility checkers (from https://github.com/rubyatscale/packwerk-extensions)
- custom public folder
- custom associations
- custom inflections
- custom load paths
- zeitwerk default namespaces
- extensible plugin system
- stale violation detection
- bin/packwerk validate (e.g. cycle detection)
