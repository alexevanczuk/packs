[![Security Audit](https://github.com/alexevanczuk/packs/actions/workflows/audit.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/alexevanczuk/packs/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Security+audit%22++)

A 100% Rust implementation of [packwerk](https://github.com/Shopify/packwerk), a gradual modularization platform for ruby.

# Goals:
## To be a drop-in replacement for `packwerk` on most projects
- Currently can serve as a drop-in replacement on Gusto's extra-large Rails monolith
- This is a work in progress! Please see [Verification](#verification) for instructions on how to verify the output of `packs` is the same as `packwerk`.

## To be 20x faster than `packwerk` on most projects
- Currently ~20x as fast as the ruby implementation. See [BENCHMARKS.md](https://github.com/alexevanczuk/packs/blob/main/BENCHMARKS.md).
- Your milemage may vary!
- Other performance improvements are coming soon!

# Usage and Documentation
Once installed and added to your `$PATH`, just call `packs` to see the CLI help message and documentation.
(Note: if you're using [`use_packs`]([url](https://github.com/rubyatscale/use_packs)) AND [`chruby`]([url](https://github.com/capistrano/chruby)), you'll need to instead call `pks` everywhere you'd normally call `packs`.)

```
Welcome! Please see https://github.com/alexevanczuk/packs for more information!

Usage: packs [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  greet                Just saying hi
  check                Look for violations in the codebase
  update               Update package_todo.yml files with the current violations
  validate             Look for validation errors in the codebase
  list_packs           List packs based on configuration in packwerk.yml
  delete_cache         `rm -rf` on your cache directory, usually `tmp/cache/packwerk`
  list_included_files  List analyzed files based on configuration in packwerk.yml
  help                 Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
      --project-root <PROJECT_ROOT>  Path for the root of the project [default: .]
  -h, --help                         Print help
  -V, --version                      Print version
```

# Installation
See [INSTALLATION.md](https://github.com/alexevanczuk/packs/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md)

# Using with VSCode Extension
`packwerk` has a VSCode Extension: https://github.com/rubyatscale/packwerk-vscode/tree/main
Using the extension with `packs` is straightforward and results in a much more responsive experience.

Directions:
- Follow [INSTALLATION.md](https://github.com/alexevanczuk/packs/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md) instructions to install `packs`
- Follow the [configuration](https://github.com/rubyatscale/packwerk-vscode/tree/main#configuration) directions to configure the extension to use `packs` instead of the ruby gem by setting the executable to `packs check`


# Verification
As `packs` is still a work-in-progress, it's possible it will not produce the same results as the ruby implementation (see [Not Yet Supported](#not-yet-supported)). If so, please file an issue â€“ I'd love to try to support your use case!

Instructions:
- Follow directions above to install `packs`
- Run `packs delete_cache`
- Run `packs update`
- Confirm the output of `git diff` is empty
- Please file an issue if it's not!

# New to Rust?
Me too! This is my first Rust project, so I'd love to have feedback, advice, and contributions!

Rust is a low-level language with high-level abstractions, a rich type system, with a focus on memory safety through innovative compile type checks on memory usage.

If you're new to Rust, don't be intimidated! [https://www.rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn) has tons of great learning resources.

If you'd like to contribute but don't know where to start, please reach out! I'd love to help you get started.

# Not yet supported
- custom associations
- custom inflections
- custom load paths
- zeitwerk default namespaces
- extensible plugin system
- stale violation detection
- bin/packwerk validate (e.g. cycle detection)
- strict mode on checkers

# Benchmarks
